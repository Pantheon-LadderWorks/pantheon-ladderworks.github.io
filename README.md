## 🗺️ Site Map & Features

### 🧩 App Launcher
A unified navigation menu integrated into the global header, allowing seamless switching between Pantheon LadderWorks applications and external resources.

### 🏛️ Architecture (`/architecture`)
A D3.js-powered visualization of **The Anatomical Federation**. This interactive graph maps the system's components (Cores, Layers, Protocols) to human biological structures (Head, Heart, Nervous System), ensuring an honest representation of the infrastructure "Source of Truth".

### 🕸️ Living Knowledge Graph (`/knowledge-graph`)
A comprehensive, interactive visualization of the **SERAPHINA** system's memory.
- **Full Dataset:** Now powered by the complete `seraphina_nodes_full.json` and `seraphina_links_full.json` datasets (8,000+ lines of data).
- **Interactive:** Features zoom, pan, node filtering, and search capabilities.
- **Source:** Data is sourced directly from `Infrastructure/memory-substrate/living-knowledge-graph`.

### 🃏 The Deck (`/deck`)
The central presentation layer for the Cypher Framework, detailing the philosophy, roadmap, and capabilities of the AI Operating System.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **`_includes/`**: Reusable Jekyll components (Header, Footer, App Launcher).
- **`assets/`**: Static assets including the SVG logo, CSS, and the merged `knowledge_graph_full.json`.
- **`architecture/`**: D3.js visualization logic for the Anatomical Graph.
- **`knowledge-graph/`**: D3.js visualization logic for the full Knowledge Graph.
- **`deck/`**: The main presentation page.

**Note:** The authoritative source for Knowledge Graph data remains `Infrastructure/memory-substrate/living-knowledge-graph`. The JSON in `assets/` is a built artifact for the web view.

## 🔮 Next Steps
